# Souna's Linux Selfbot
Not much to say. I'll add the list of features later. ðŸ“ƒ

For short, it's only to make an app to play with Linux and Discord's API for voice things or "streaming". ðŸŽ®

PS: I almost died when I saw the `index.js` file of someone's selfbot to see how things were done (I thought it was different from an usual bot) ðŸ’€
